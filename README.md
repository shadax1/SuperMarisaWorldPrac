# SuperMarisaWorldPrac
Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/shadax1/SuperMarisaWorldPrac/releases) and add the .exe file into your Super Marisa World game folder. Start the game then the practice tool and you will be good to go.
Note: your game must be at version 1.05

## Potential issues with stage detection
When Marisa is in a stage, the tool will either show which one she's in or it will display an error message. In case of the former, then the tool is working as expected. For the latter, the tool will tell you to click the 'Rescan' button in an attempt to find the correct memory address to point to.
If it fails then there isn't much I can do aside from telling you to follow [this little guide](https://youtu.be/xBSTnnGhPpo) I made which requires Cheat Engine (I use version 6.3) in an effort to find the correct pointer. Take a screenshot of the final screen in Cheat Engine and send it over to me either on Twitter [@shadax1](https://twitter.com/Shadax1) or on Discord to Shadax#6921
